# Deprecated
This was the *third* iteration of the backend API supporting smite-one. It was fine for toying around and experimenting but I didn't think it could scale if access to Smite's developer API opened up, so I rewrote it again: https://github.com/undo-k/smite-mono

In this iteration of smite-one, this Go api was backed by a postgresql database living in a railway instance and supported a Vue SPA, https://github.com/undo-k/smite-one
